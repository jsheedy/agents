A stark, high-contrast image. In the foreground, a primitive hominid stands silhouetted against a desolate, ancient landscape. Their hand is raised, clutching a bone, mirroring the iconic scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey. The bone is positioned as if about to be thrown, symbolizing the first use of a tool and the dawn of technology. The background is blurred slightly, emphasizing the hominid and the bone. The overall mood is one of primal discovery and a pivotal moment in evolution.
