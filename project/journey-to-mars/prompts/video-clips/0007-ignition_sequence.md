A building intensity shot, spanning 6 seconds. First 3 seconds: Low angle looking up at full Starship stack against pre-dawn gradient sky, cryogenic steam venting, stars above, stillness loaded with potential energy. Last 3 seconds: Extreme close-up as 33 Raptor engines ignite in cascade, green-white flame erupting, camera shake, intense light flooding everything, blast wave rippling air. Static calm EXPLODING into raw power. Metallic textures, heat distortion. The mood is anticipation detonating into primal energy. Style: IMAX documentary grandeur meets First Man visceral intensity.
