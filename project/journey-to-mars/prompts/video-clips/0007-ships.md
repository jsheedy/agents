A sweeping, adventurous montage, spanning 6 seconds. The clip begins with a shot of an early, simple sailing vessel on a calm sea. It then quickly transitions through a series of increasingly complex and powerful ships: a Viking longship cutting through waves, a majestic galleon with full sails, a fleet of steam-powered ironclads, and finally a massive, modern container ship traversing the ocean. The camera follows the ships, conveying a sense of global exploration and commerce. The mood is one of discovery, expansion, and the interconnectedness of the world.
