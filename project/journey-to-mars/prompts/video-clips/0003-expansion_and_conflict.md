A rapid-fire montage, spanning 6 seconds. Three sequences, 2 seconds each: (1) Roman legions marching, cavalry charging, arrows flying - warfare shots cutting fast; (2) Ships evolution - sailing vessel to Viking longship to galleon to ironclad, quick dissolves; (3) Bustling marketplace, merchants trading, global commerce, different cultures meeting. Kinetic camera work, whip pans between shots. Epic scale, high contrast, saturated colors. The mood is expansion, conflict, interconnection. Style: Historical epic battle sequences, fast-cut trailer pacing, commerce documentary.
