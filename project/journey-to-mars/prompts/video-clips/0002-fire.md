A close-up shot of a pair of primitive hands, carefully nurturing a small, flickering flame. The hands are cupped around the fire, protecting it. The background is dark and out of focus, with only the warm glow of the fire illuminating the hands and faces of a small group of hominids huddled together. The mood is one of warmth, community, and the harnessing of a powerful natural force.
