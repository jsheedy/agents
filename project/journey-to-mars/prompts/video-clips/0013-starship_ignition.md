A powerful, dramatic shot, spanning 6 seconds. The clip begins with a close-up of the Starship's Raptor engines. They burst to life with a brilliant, intense flame. The camera shakes with the force of the ignition, and the sound design (to be added later) is deafening. The light from the engines illuminates the launchpad and the surrounding landscape. The mood is one of immense power, controlled chaos, and the release of incredible energy.
