A powerful montage, spanning 6 seconds. Industrial imagery cutting rhythmically: massive factory gears turning, steam locomotive thundering with smoke, looms weaving at extreme speed, molten metal pouring, factory smokestacks against dusk sky. Each shot 1-1.5 seconds. Mechanical rhythm drives cuts. High contrast, dramatic shadows, warm industrial lighting, iron and brass textures. The mood is relentless mechanization, steam age power, modern world emerging. Style: Koyaanisqatsi industrial sequences, mechanical ballet, gritty Victorian aesthetic.
