A dramatic, anticipatory clip, spanning 6 seconds. The clip starts with a wide shot of the Earth from space, with digital networks and flight paths crisscrossing the globe. The camera then rapidly zooms in on a specific location: a launchpad where a massive, futuristic rocket stands ready. The rocket is sleek and powerful, unlike any we've seen before. The final shot is a close-up of the rocket's engines, which begin to glow with energy. The mood is one of culmination, of all of human history leading to this single moment.
