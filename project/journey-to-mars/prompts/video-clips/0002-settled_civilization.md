A compressed montage, spanning 6 seconds. Two accelerated sequences, 3 seconds each: (1) Time-lapse of barren land transforming into crop rows, zoom to harvesting hands; (2) Aerial time-lapse of settlement exploding into sprawling ancient city, walls erecting, temples multiplying, streets forming geometric patterns. Extremely fast pacing, seasons cycling, buildings erupting from ground. Warm Mediterranean palette, golden agricultural light transitioning to urban dawn. The mood is explosive growth, civilization taking root. Style: Planet Earth hyper-lapse, SimCity god-view construction.
