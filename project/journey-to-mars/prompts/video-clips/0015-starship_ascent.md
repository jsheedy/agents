A beautiful, serene shot, spanning 6 seconds. The Starship is now high in the atmosphere, a silver needle against the deep blue of the sky. It is ascending rapidly, leaving a long, white contrail in its wake. The camera follows the rocket as it gets smaller and smaller, until it is just a bright star disappearing into the blackness of space. The mood is one of hope, of reaching for the future, and of the vastness of the cosmos.
