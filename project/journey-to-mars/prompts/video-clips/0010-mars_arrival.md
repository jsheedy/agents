Next 2 seconds: Starship enters orbit, curved rust-colored horizon. Final 2 seconds: Descent through thin atmosphere, retro-rockets firing, dust plumes on surface, ship steadying and touching down on flat plain landing site. Accelerating pace, building to landing moment. Orange-red Mars terrain, engine fire blue-white. The mood is approach, precision, arrival at new world. Style: The Martian mission sequences, documentary realism.
