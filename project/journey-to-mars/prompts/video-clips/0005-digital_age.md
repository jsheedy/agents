A split montage, spanning 6 seconds. Two major leaps, 3 seconds each: (1) Space Age - grainy Sputnik, Saturn V launch, moon boot landing, Space Shuttle, ISS orbiting, archival to modern; (2) AI Era - neural network visualization glowing blue, self-driving car, robotic arm, code scrolling, facial recognition. First half historical/majestic, second half sleek/digital. Color progression from vintage to blue-cyan digital. The mood is boundary-breaking then consciousness-emerging. Style: Cosmos documentary wonder transitioning to Blade Runner 2049 UI tech.
