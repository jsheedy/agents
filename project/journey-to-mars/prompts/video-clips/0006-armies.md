A dynamic and fast-paced montage, spanning 6 seconds. The clip rapidly cuts between different scenes of ancient warfare: a line of Roman legionaries marching in perfect formation, a cavalry charge across a dusty plain, a volley of arrows being fired from a castle wall, and a fleet of triremes clashing at sea. The cuts are quick and rhythmic, synchronized to a driving beat (which the user will add later). The mood is one of conflict, power, and the organized chaos of war.
