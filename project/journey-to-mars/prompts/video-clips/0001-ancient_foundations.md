An ultra-fast montage, spanning 6 seconds. Three pivotal moments, 2 seconds each: (1) Hominid raising bone tool against sky, 2001 homage, dramatic silhouette; (2) Primitive hands cupping first flame, faces illuminated by fire glow; (3) Wooden wheel rolling across ground, low angle tracking shot. Rapid cuts synchronized to building rhythm. High contrast, dramatic lighting progression from dawn to firelight to golden hour. The mood is rapid evolution, fundamental discoveries. Style: Koyaanisqatsi time-compression, Baraka human journey, aggressive cutting pace.
