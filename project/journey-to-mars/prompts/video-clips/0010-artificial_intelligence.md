A futuristic, abstract montage, spanning 6 seconds. The clip begins with a visualization of a neural network, with glowing nodes and connecting lines. It then transitions to a rapid sequence of images: a self-driving car navigating a busy street, a robotic arm performing a delicate task, a screen full of scrolling code, and a human face being recognized by a computer. The visuals are sleek, digital, and complex. The mood is one of intelligence, automation, and the emergence of a new form of consciousness.
