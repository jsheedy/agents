A gritty, powerful montage, spanning 6 seconds. The clip opens with a close-up of a massive, turning gear in a factory. It then cuts to a steam locomotive thundering down a track, billowing smoke. We see quick shots of looms weaving cloth at incredible speed, molten metal being poured in a steel mill, and the silhouette of a factory skyline at dusk. The pace is fast and rhythmic, driven by the relentless motion of machines. The mood is one of dramatic change, industrial might, and the dawn of the modern era.
