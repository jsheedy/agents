An iconic moment, spanning 6 seconds. First 3 seconds: Starship airlock opens, spacesuited figure appears in doorway silhouetted against Mars landscape, pausing to take it in. Last 3 seconds: Descending ladder, boot making contact with red Martian soil - low angle captures first step, parallel to Moon landing. Endless rust-red horizon stretches behind. Slow deliberate movement, historic weight. Orange Mars daylight, spacesuit white against red. The mood is triumph, epochal moment, humans becoming multiplanetary. Style: Apollo mission photography, historic documentation, intimate yet grand.
