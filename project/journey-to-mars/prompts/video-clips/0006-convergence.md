A dramatic transition shot, spanning 6 seconds. Opens with Earth from space, digital networks and flight paths pulsing across globe like neural pathways. Camera rapidly zooms down through atmosphere, continents blurring past, zeroing in on specific location: SpaceX Starbase Texas. Massive silver Starship appears on launchpad in pre-dawn light. Final shot pushes close on Raptor engine cluster beginning to glow with energy. Blue-white digital aesthetic transitioning to physical steel reality. The mood is all history converging to this single point. Style: Google Earth dramatic zoom, mission control POV.
