A majestic launch sequence, spanning 6 seconds. First 3 seconds: Wide angle Starship lifting off in slow motion, massive rocket rising gracefully, engine flames billowing, ground engulfed in smoke and steam, launch tower framing. Last 3 seconds: Starship high in atmosphere, silver needle against gradient sky darkening to space, ascending rapidly leaving white contrail, camera tilting up as rocket diminishes to bright point among emerging stars. Triumph transitioning to cosmic serenity. The mood is defying gravity, journey beginning, reaching for infinity. Style: Right Stuff heroic cinematography meets Gravity opening sequence grace.
