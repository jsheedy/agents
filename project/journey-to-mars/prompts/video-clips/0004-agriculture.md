A time-lapse video, spanning 6 seconds. The scene starts with a wide shot of a barren landscape. Over the first 3 seconds, the land is transformed: neat rows of crops appear and grow rapidly, from seedlings to mature plants. For the final 3 seconds, the camera slowly zooms in on a pair of hands harvesting the crops, symbolizing the fruits of this new technology. The overall mood is one of abundance, growth, and the dawn of civilization.
