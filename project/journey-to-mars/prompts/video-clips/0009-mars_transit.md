A vast, contemplative shot, spanning 6 seconds. Starship in deep space, small vessel against infinite blackness and stars. Mars appears as small red dot growing gradually larger through the clip. Earth visible behind as receding blue marble. Camera slowly tracks ship crossing this immense gulf. Minimal movement, emphasizing scale and isolation. Deep space black, Mars rust-red growing, Earth blue fading. The mood is isolation, determination, vast interplanetary distance, the crossing. Style: 2001 space ballet meditation, Interstellar cosmic scale, real NASA deep space imagery.
