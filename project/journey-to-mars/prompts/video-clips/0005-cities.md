A time-lapse video, spanning 6 seconds. The camera is positioned high above a landscape, looking down. Over the course of the clip, a small settlement of simple buildings appears and then rapidly grows into a sprawling ancient city. We see walls being erected, temples and houses multiplying, and a network of streets forming. The final shot shows the bustling city, full of life and activity, with tiny figures moving through the streets. The mood is one of exponential growth and the rise of complex societies.
