An accelerating time-lapse finale, spanning 6 seconds. Starting from single landed Starship, Mars base rapidly takes shape: habitat modules deploying, solar panels unfolding like flowers, rovers tracking across surface leaving trails, greenhouses appearing with first green life, multiple ships landing in sequence, base growing from one ship to sprawling settlement. Camera pulls back revealing expanding human presence. Increasing pace mirroring the opening bone-to-space-station cut from 2001. The mood is growth, permanence, journey completing, new beginning. Style: Baraka time-lapse, 2001 evolutionary leap, full circle from raised bone to Mars city.
