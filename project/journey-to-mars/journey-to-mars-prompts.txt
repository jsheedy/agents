CLIP 0006: 0006-convergence.md
OUTPUT: journey-to-mars-0006.mp4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A dramatic transition shot, spanning 6 seconds. Opens with Earth from space, digital networks and flight paths pulsing across globe like neural pathways. Camera rapidly zooms down through atmosphere, continents blurring past, zeroing in on specific location: SpaceX Starbase Texas. Massive silver Starship appears on launchpad in pre-dawn light. Final shot pushes close on Raptor engine cluster beginning to glow with energy. Blue-white digital aesthetic transitioning to physical steel reality. The mood is all history converging to this single point. Style: Google Earth dramatic zoom, mission control POV.
================================================================================

CLIP 0007: 0007-ignition_sequence.md
OUTPUT: journey-to-mars-0007.mp4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A building intensity shot, spanning 6 seconds. First 3 seconds: Low angle looking up at full Starship stack against pre-dawn gradient sky, cryogenic steam venting, stars above, stillness loaded with potential energy. Last 3 seconds: Extreme close-up as 33 Raptor engines ignite in cascade, green-white flame erupting, camera shake, intense light flooding everything, blast wave rippling air. Static calm EXPLODING into raw power. Metallic textures, heat distortion. The mood is anticipation detonating into primal energy. Style: IMAX documentary grandeur meets First Man visceral intensity.

A majestic launch sequence, spanning 6 seconds. First 3 seconds: Wide angle Starship lifting off in slow motion, massive rocket rising gracefully, engine flames billowing, ground engulfed in smoke and steam, launch tower framing. Last 3 seconds: Starship high in atmosphere, silver needle against gradient sky darkening to space, ascending rapidly leaving white contrail, camera tilting up as rocket diminishes to bright point among emerging stars. Triumph transitioning to cosmic serenity. The mood is defying gravity, journey beginning, reaching for infinity. Style: Right Stuff heroic cinematography meets Gravity opening sequence grace.

CLIP 0009: 0009-mars_transit.md
OUTPUT: journey-to-mars-0009.mp4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A vast, contemplative shot, spanning 6 seconds. Starship in deep space, small vessel against infinite blackness and stars. Mars appears as small red dot growing gradually larger through the clip. Earth visible behind as receding blue marble. Camera slowly tracks ship crossing this immense gulf. Minimal movement, emphasizing scale and isolation. Deep space black, Mars rust-red growing, Earth blue fading. The mood is isolation, determination, vast interplanetary distance, the crossing. Style: 2001 space ballet meditation, Interstellar cosmic scale, real NASA deep space imagery.

A dynamic arrival sequence, spanning 6 seconds. First 2 seconds: Mars filling frame showing surface details - canyons, craters, Olympus Mons, polar ice. Next 2 seconds: Starship enters orbit, curved rust-colored horizon. Final 2 seconds: Descent through thin atmosphere, retro-rockets firing, dust plumes on surface, ship steadying and touching down on flat plain landing site. Accelerating pace, building to landing moment. Orange-red Mars terrain, engine fire blue-white. The mood is approach, precision, arrival at new world.

Starting from single landed Starship, Mars base rapidly takes shape: habitat modules deploying, solar panels unfolding like flowers, rovers tracking across surface leaving trails, greenhouses appearing with first green life, multiple ships landing in sequence, base growing from one ship to sprawling settlement. Camera pulls back revealing expanding human presence. Increasing pace mirroring the opening bone-to-space-station cut from 2001. The mood is growth, permanence, journey completing, new beginning. Style: Baraka time-lapse, 2001 evolutionary leap, full circle from raised bone to Mars city.
