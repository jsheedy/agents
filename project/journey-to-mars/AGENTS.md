This project will result in a music video detailing the progression of technology from the first humans to the setting up of first cities on Mars.

The project is divided into a series of 6-second video clips, each with a detailed prompt. The prompts are located in the `prompts/video-clips` directory, and are also collected in the `megaprompt.md` file.

The video sequence is now complete, from the dawn of tools to the first Martian sunrise.

The next steps are:
1. Generate the video clips from the prompts in `megaprompt.md`.
2. Create a music track that aligns with the video clips.
3. Edit the video clips and music together to create the final music video.
